				<h2>About</h2>
                <p>This is my study on soccer in the 3d animation I learned in this semester. This is a very attractive attempt. Through the layout, I learned how to use cloth to modify and also know how to use mat to decorate a color. For me it is a fun try. </p>

        	<div class ="aboutprotfilo">
				<h2>Difficult</h2>
                <p>Since this is the first time I set the whole background, there are many places that are not proficient at all. For example, the layout of the background, which made me think for a day. When I first started to use the rectangle to find that I was too rigid, the overall appearance seemed Not very good-looking, so I use the hexagonal shape and use the cylinder as a lamp to describe, try a different color Finally select the blue light and orange light is more clear, and then is <a href="#" id = "show1" class="show">Read More</a><span class = "hidden more" id="more1">the rendering of the problem, rendering nearly Two days, it really makes people feel a headache.<a href = "#" class ="close" id="close1">Close</a></span></p>
